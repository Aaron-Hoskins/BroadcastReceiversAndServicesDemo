- Broadcast Receivers
    - The Component used by android to send signals across the system
    - DOES NOT PERSIST THE SIGNAL (data sent)
    - 2 Types
        - Manifest Declared
            - Declared within the manifest
            - Will be activated if a signal is sent with correlating action string
            - Intent filter for the actions are defined within manifest
            - Implicit Manifest Declared receivers are NOT allowed as of SDK 26
        - Context Registered
            - Declared within the component's source code which it is attached to
            - Only active if that component is actively loaded into memory
            - Intent filters are defined within the source code
            - MUST register and unregister in onStart and onStop
    - All signals are received and processed within the receivers onReceive method(function)
    - Broadcast receivers can be restricted in 2 ways
        - LocalBroadcastManager
            - restrict broadcast to within the host app itself
        - Permissions
            - Permission is assigned when sending broadcast, and only apps with that permission can
                receive it

- Services
    - The component used by android for long running operations
    - Types of services
        - Started Serviced
            - The service will run once started until task is complete, then will stop unless stopped
                manually
            - Kinds of started (an bub category of services)
                - Foreground Services
                    - Used when app is within the foreground of operation
                    - As of SDK 23, Must display a notification in the Notification Menu that it is running
                    - Runs on Main thread by default
                - Background Services
                    - Used when the app is running an operation that the user may not need to know about explicitly
                    - As of SDK 23, can not be run by application that is not in the foreground for more than 5 seconds
                    - Runs on Main Thread by default
                - Intent Services (sub type of Background)
                    - Used when you need an operation that is not associated to Main thread
                    - Used Intent actions/filters to define the task that will be performed by the service
                    - Request to intent services run sequentially
                    - Runs on worker thread by default
        - Bound Services
            - One Kind
                - Bound Services
                    - Service will run once bound to until that service is unbounded
                    - Uses a client/Server relationship
                    - Runs on Main Thread by default
                    - Can be interacted with when running
                    - Uses the ServiceConnection object for communication between the component which
                        the service is bound to and the service itself
                    - Usually some sort of IPC(Interprocces communication) is supplied
                        - Binder/IBinder
                        - Messenger
    - To change the thread that process will run on other than set by default, you can you the
        "android:process" attribute for service in the manifest to whatever scheme you wish
    - If you have a task that is long running and needs to be completed at a later time, or if you have a
        task that needs to happen periodically you need to use some form of Intelligent Job Scheduling
        - Commonly used Intelligent Job Scheduling
            - Job Schedulers
                - Used when you have a task that needs to run periodically (Updates)
            - Work Managers
                - JetPack Component
                - Simplified Job Scheduler
            - Download Manager
                - Used to download files
            - Alarm Manager
                - Used to run a task at a specific time

    - Lifecycle of Services
        - Started Service
            onCreate
            onStartCommand
            onStop
            onDestroy

        - Bound Serives
            onCreate
            onBind
            onUnbind
            onDestroy
